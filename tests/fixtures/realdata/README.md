# Real-World Test Fixtures

Production data samples for testing Portolan's orchestration layer.

**Full documentation:** [`context/shared/documentation/test-fixtures.md`](../../../context/shared/documentation/test-fixtures.md)

**Key point:** Portolan orchestrates — it does not validate geometry. These fixtures test orchestration, not upstream library behavior.
